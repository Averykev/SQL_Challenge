SQL Challenge:

This project utilizes SQL to research employees of a company from the 1980s and 1990s.  The project showcases the design of the tables to hold data from 6 different CSVs, 
import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data.  It is a combination of data engineering and data analysis.

INSTRUCTIONS:  To see this project, just run the Jupyter notebooks and create the tables in postgreSQL using the SQL table design scripts.
